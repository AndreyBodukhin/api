## List of comments

Receiving the list of comments is available only for an employer. The list will
contain comments of the current user as well as comments of other company
managers provided that the managers made these comments accessible to others at
the moment of posting.


### Request

No need to construct the request url on your own – it should be received from
the [owner CV field](resumes.md#owner-field)

`GET /applicant_comments/{applicant_id}`

where `applicant_id` is the applicant ID.

Additional request parameters:

* [`page` and `per_page` pagination parameters](general.md#pagination)
* `order_by` – comments sorting, available values are provided in the
  [`applicant_comments_order` reference](dictionaries.md)


### Response

Successful server response is returned with `200 OK` code and contains:
