# Paid access to some API methods for employers

As of July 16, 2018, some API HH methods will become paid for employers.

Such methods are labeled <img src="http://hhru.github.io/api/badges/emp_paid.png" alt="employer with paid access" /> in the [contents](README.md#headhunter-api).

Please contact your personal manager to buy access to paid methods for employers.

Please note that if the app uses several employer accounts (employer_id), then each must have access to the paid API methods.

If you try to use a paid method without purchasing access, you will get a [`403 Forbidden` error](errors.md#employer_payable_methods).
